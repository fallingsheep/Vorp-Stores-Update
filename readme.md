# Store updates
This adds ALL items from the premade files to the stores
(if you dont have the new items see the 200+ new items update here - https://github.com/fallingsheep/Vorp-Items-Updates )

- adds 10 new stores
- all items support the random prices (min,max)
- weapon parts are now found at fences
- no 'doctor items' are included (doctor shops coming soon)

## **WARNING!**  
always take a backup before changing/updating any files or databases!  
this adds EVERY ITEM to the stores so you will need to remove what you dont want to buy/sell  
(eg if you dont want handcuffs sold/bought then remove them, best way is to comment them out)  
buy and sell prices are not balanced in any way  
the only "balance" is items sell for approx half the buy cost
